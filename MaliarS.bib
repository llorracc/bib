               The algorithms differ substantially in terms of speed and

               Perturbation methods are very fast but invoke large

               needed, help them transit from one programming language to

  abstract = "Artificial intelligence (AI) has impressive applications in many
              fields (speech recognition, computer vision, etc.). This paper
              demonstrates that AI can be also used to analyze complex and
              high-dimensional dynamic economic models. We show how to convert
              three fundamental objects of economic dynamics -- lifetime
              reward, Bellman equation and Euler equation -- into objective
              functions suitable for deep learning (DL). We introduce
              all-in-one integration technique that makes the stochastic
              gradient unbiased for the constructed objective functions. We
              show how to use neural networks to deal with multicollinearity
              and perform model reduction in Krusell and Smith's (1998) model
              in which decision functions depend on thousands of state
              variables -- we literally feed distributions into neural
              networks! In our examples, the DL method was reliable, accurate
              and linearly scalable. Our ubiquitous Python code, built with
              Dolo and Google TensorFlow platforms, is designed to accommodate
              a variety of models and applications.",

              Function}}",
  author   = "Maliar, Lilia and Maliar, Serguei",
  abstract = "This paper studies the properties of the social utility function
              defined by the planner's problem of Constantinides (1982). We
              show one set of restrictions on the optimal planner's policy
              rule, which is sufficient for constructing the social utility
              function analytically. For such well-known classes of utility
              functions as the HARA and the CES, our construction is equivalent
              to Gorman's (1953) aggregation. However, we can also construct
              the social utility function analytically in some cases when
              Gorman's (1953) representative consumer does not exist; in such
              cases, the social utility function depends on ``heterogeneity''
              parameters. Our results can be used for simplifying the analysis
              of equilibrium in dynamic heterogeneous-agent models.",
